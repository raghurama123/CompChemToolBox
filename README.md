The repository collects short codes used in our group for various miscellaneous #compchem tasks. As time permits, I will add more notes in the wiki tab of this repository.

The code [Fix4Obminimize/obminimize_all.py](https://github.com/raghurama123/CompChemToolBox/tree/main/Fix4Obminimize) gives a remedy. More details are collected in the [README file](https://github.com/raghurama123/CompChemToolBox/blob/main/Fix4Obminimize/example/README.txt)
